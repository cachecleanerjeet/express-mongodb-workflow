# Express MongoDB Workflow

### You should follow this workflow to build your easily maintainable, secure API with ExpressJS and MongoDB.

Check source code you will get the idea. This workflow is also followed by me. Create an issue to give me suggestions. Don't forget to read the docs (Perfectly autogenerated with swagger-autogen), it is available on `http://localhost:3000/docs`.

### Setup DEV enviroment

- Rename `env` to `.env` & fill everything
- Install dependencies by running `npm i`
- `npm run dev` to run this as development

### Advance Note:

- Create a fulltext search index `db.posts.createIndex({ title: "text", content: "text" })`
